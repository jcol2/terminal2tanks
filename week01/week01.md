### What is programming?
* Writing a program
* A program is "A structured collection of instruction sequences that perform a specific task when executed by a computer" [1]
* Written in a programming language.
* Popular programming languages: Python, C/C++, Java, C#, Javascript
---

### What is Python?
* An "Interpreted high-level programming language" [2]
* Great for beginners
* Forgiving, simple, powerful
---

## Getting Started
### Installing Python3 and Sublime Text
* Python3: http://python.org/downloads
* Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/3
---

### The terminal
* The terminal is the commandline of your computer
* It allows you to call the Python interpreter and execute programs
* To open a terminal on Windows, open the Start menu and search for 'cmd'. Open it
* To open a terminal on Mac OSX, click the search button and search for 'terminal'. Open it

### The Python interpreter
* Interprets and executes commands on-the-fly
* You can access the interpreter by opening a terminal, typing `python3`, and pressing enter
* You can execute a command in the interpreter by typing the command and pressing enter
* Try executing these commands in the interpreter:
    - `1+1`
    - `10-5`
    - `4*5`
    - `10/5`
    - `10**2`
    - `10%3`
---

### Calculations

### The `print()` command
* Used to 'print' something to the screen
* Try typing these commands in the interpreter:
    - `print(1)`
    - `print(1+1)`
    - `print("Python is fun!")`

## Your First Program
### Creating the program
* On your desktop, create a folder called 'terminal2tanks'
* Inside this folder, create a folder called 'week01'
* Open Sublime Text, and save a file called 'hello_world.py' in the 'week01' folder
* In 'hello_world.py', type the following:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
* Save the file
---

### Executing the program
* Open a terminal
* If you're using Mac OSX:
    - Type `cd ~/Desktop/terminal2tanks/week01` in the terminal and press enter
* If you're using Windows:
    - Type `cd /d %UserProfile%\Desktop\terminal2tanks\week01` in the terminal and press enter
* Type `python3 hello_world.py` and press enter

### Congratulations!
* You've written your first program!
---

### Hello, `[user]`!
* Create a new file in the `week01` folder, called `hello_user.py`.
* Instead of printing `Hello, World!`, write a program that prints `Hello, [user]!`, where `user` is your name.
* For example, my program would print `Hello, Jeremy!`
* Execute the program with the command `python3 hello_user.py`
